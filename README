Overview
========

RunAsService is a learning project with the goal of providing a simple mechanism to run any non-terminating Windows CLI executable as a Windows service. Even though the name is the same and the goals very similar, it is not to be confused with the RunAsService project over at sourceforge (http://runasservice.sourceforge.net/). This project is purely educational and will be kept as simple as humanly possible.
